<h1>FNB Fraud Detection</h1>

<p>
    A data-driven system that detects simulated fraudulent transactions for a South African bank by analyzing transaction patterns and user behavior. It flags suspicious activities to help prevent financial fraud.
</p>
<p>
    Built to showcase my knowledge in data pipelines and fraud in banking by providing automated fraud detection using synthetic and real-like transaction data. This solution helps my mock bank improve security and reduce financial losses through meaningful insights.

<h2>Why This Project?</h2>
<p>
    Manual fraud detection is slow and and prone to errors. This project automates the process using rule-based detection on generated transaction data, making fraud identification faster and more reliable.

<h2>Project Information</h2>
<p>
    This project generates synthetic user and transaction data imitating a South African bankâ€™s dataset, then applies rule based fraud detection logic to identify potentially fraudulent transactions. The data is stored in PostgreSQL and served via a FastAPI backend, while the frontend visualizes user risk scores and fraud analytics interactively. This design allows easy expansion and integration with real bank data for practical use.
